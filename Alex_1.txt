Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

And all that’s best of dark and bright

Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

09 She walks in beauty, like the night
09 Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
